## Step 5 - Getting older, getting unhealthier :older_man:

Now that your pet can get older, it can also begin to feel the effects of age.

Your challenge in this step is to adapt the `Pet` function so that growing up also makes it hungrier and less fit.

This can be broken down into steps:

- The `Pet` should have an initial `hunger` of `0`
- The `growUp` method should increase the `hunger` property by `5`
- The `Pet` should have an initial `fitness` of `10`
- The `growUp` method should decrease the `fitness` property by `3`

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI
- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour
- implement the code to make the tests pass

Once you are done, commit your work and push to GitHub
