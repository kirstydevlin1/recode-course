### Step 9 - Death :skull:

We can now feed and walk our pets, but how do we know when we need to?

Your challenge in this step is to give the `Pet` function an `isAlive` property that really lets you know how the pet is feeling.

- if the pet's fitness is 0 or less, it should return `false`.
- if the pet's hunger is 10 or more, it should return `false`.
- if the pet's age is 30 or more, it should return `false`.
- otherwise it should return `true`.

## Learning objectives
- Using getter methods to compute property values

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI
- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour
- add a getter function to `Pet`'s prototype

Once you are done, commit your work, push to GitHub, and switch roles. :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
