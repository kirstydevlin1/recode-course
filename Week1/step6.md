## How do you learn?

What kind of learner are you?

This short quiz will give you some idea of what type of learning works best for you: http://how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/

Your result might be a surprise to you, or it might be just what you expected. You might find that in reality you work well with more than one type of learning; this quiz just offers a simple overview. 

In all lines of work, including ones like coding, you will be learning new things all the time whether that’s something you find interesting and want to know more, or whether it’s a way of working specific to the organisation you’re working for, Therefor, it’s very important to figure out how you learn best. You might find that simply reading up on a subject will teach you all you need to know, or maybe a YouTube tutorial will help more. The main types of learning are audio, visual, kinesthetic (learn by doing), and the combinations of all of the above.

Once you’ve figured out how you learn best, everything you need to learn suddenly seems much more accessible. What you deemed to be a difficult subject will now become something you can easily tackle. Human beings love to learn things, by nature. So embrace that!

If you have any questions or feel like you need some extra help with your learning process, don’t be afraid to ask us (the tutors) or even your peers
