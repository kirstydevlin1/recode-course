## Fake news

Now you're all more familiar with the Inspector. I want you to create some fake news!

Go to your favorite news website of choice and find an article. Click on it, and use the inspector to write your own! You can edit HTML in the inspector by double clicking on an element.

I expect you to take some time on this, I want to see you flex any existing knowledge of HTML and CSS you might have.

If you're feeling really creative, maybe rebrand the site to change some of its primary colors!
