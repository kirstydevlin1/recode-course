Hello Everyone! Are you as excited to start this course as I am?

Every web developer has their own preferences and setup, but for the sake of the course, I'm going to ask you all to have the same base to work off. This will ensure we can help each other and have the same opportunities to learning. 

Let's introduce some of the Apps and Services we'll be using in the course!

<h3>Github</h3>

You are here!<br/>

Moodle cloud is your resource for the lesson overview (and previous lessons!) If you miss something during a lesson or prefer to read through notes, they'll be here.

As the course continues, there may be additional tasks uploaded to Moodle Cloud if you'd like additional practice

<h3>Windows 10</h3>

The operating system!<br/>
An operating system (OS) is the computer program that manages resources and performs basic tasks and examples include Windows, Linux, iOS and Android.
Everything we do will assume you're on Windows 10, and I'll be checking to make sure everyone is up to date and has a computer capable of running the code we'll be using. Web development can sometimes be a resource intensive process on a computer, as you have to run the website you're developing, your coding tools and any debug software also!

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>

The browser!<br/>

The web browser is a program that interprets HTML, CSS and Javascript sent from an external server, and turns it into the websites we all know and love. For this course, we'll be developing on google Chrome. It's one of the most popular web browsers out there, and also supports most modern web features. There can be differences in the ways that browsers interpret web code, so it's very important we stick to one browser on this course.

Other browsers include Firefox, Edge, Safari and Internet Explorer, and we'll be exploring those and their differences later on.

<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

Where the magic happens!

Visual Studio Code (or VSCode, sometimes just "Code") is our Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Most of your work will be done in this. It might seem daunting at first, but we'll work through its features during the next few days.  VSCode is an industry standard application, and once you learn this, it'll be easy to use other IDEs. 

VSCode supports more than just web languages! You can make apps and games, and code in a variety of languages. It also features extensions, which allow you to add more features, themes and general quality of life improvements. We'll be keeping things simple for now, but one example of a useful extension is a Bracket Colorizer. To see which brackets match each other!

<h3>Slack</h3>

Our chat app.
Slack is a communication tool used in lots of businesses. Chats are grouped into "Channels" such as #random, #general, #launchpad etc. Some channels are set to private and some public. You can also private message members (such as Jessica, Rachel or Kirsty for questions!)

There is also the ability to add custom functionality to slack, such as chatbots that respond to specific phrases, or services that post in the channel when an event has occurred.

<h3>Other things</h3>

<h4>The console</h4>

The console is where you can do more advanced tasks, which don't have a nice User Interface (UI). We will be using this much later on in the course when running some advanced Javascript. All computers used to be just purely command line only! 

<h4>The file browser</h4>

The file browser is something you should get aquainted with. I think organisation is important, and this is where most of your project files will be stored! Here is where you'll create new files, folders, and generally can see everything on your computer. If you'd like help coming up with a filing system just ask Jessica!
