## Getting comfortable with VS Code and setting up projects

Becoming comfortable with your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a key part of being a good developer.

For this course, we'll be primarily using VS Code. You've all had it installed and set up, so lets learn how to create a project and open it up in VSCode!

Firstly, we want to learn how to use the Windows explorer.

You can quickly open the windows explorer by pressing Windows Key+E.

For Recode, you'll want to create a separate folder which will hold all of your project files.

I keep all my folders in my User Directory (C:\Users\username), although feel free to add them in your My Documents folder, or even in a cloud backup service like OneDrive or Google Drive.

Having a solid format and folder structure is really important, as keeping a clean set of folders means you don't waste time or mental effort remembering where everything is. Backups are super important also! We will be looking at some backup solutions later, but I highly recommend looking into some on your own time. OneDrive and Google Drive have some free plans available. 

So I want you to find a nice place to store all your project files, create a Recode folder, and create a subfolder for Week 1 day 5.

Okay! Now we're set up with our folders, let's open up VSCode, and open the folder we just created

And now we can right click on the left hand pane and create a new file. 

Call it index.html

index.html is the default file that a server or webbrowser will look for, so that's why we call our initial page this!

Lastly, let's copy the HTML into our editor. You'll see how VSCode's autocomplete (or intellisense) will show you potential code, a bit like autocorrect on your phone.

As a quick task, create a second HTML page, and learn some of VSCode's shortcuts for searching in files, finding files etc!

Lastly, customize your VSCode setup with some themes from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes">here</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=vscode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads">here</a>
