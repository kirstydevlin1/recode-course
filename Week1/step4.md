## HTML Basics!

HTML is known as a "Markup language", that's what the ML stands for!

Markup languages are descriptive, they describe ways of organising information, and then it's up to another application to read that markup and display it in an appropriate way.

Another example of Markup, would be how Microsoft Word stores its files. It points to where bold text should begin and end, etc. HTML does the same thing with its &lt;b&gt; tags

The core components of HTML are Tags, which form Elements.

The most important thing to understand is this concept of Tags and Elements.

Tags need to be closed. They can contain content, such as in the above examples, and also tags can be self-closing such as &lt;img /&gt;

Self closing tags are easy to recognise because they have a forward slash at the end, rather than an opening tag, which contains no forward slash, or a closing tag, which contains one after the first Triangle Bracket.

Elements can contain other elements within themselves, this is known as 'nesting'. Think of a russian doll arrangement.

Nesting is another very important feature of HTML, combined with the div, or divider tag, it is a useful way of separating your content, as well as containing elements within other elements.

Let's talk about attributes!

Attributes and Values (or key/value pairs, lots of other terms!) are a way of associating some data with a tag. These go 'inside' the tag, note <i>not</i> inside of the element. Spacing is very important when adding attribute values, so pay attention to that!
