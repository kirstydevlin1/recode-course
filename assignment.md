# Assignment - CodeWars

We've been working all week on mini-kata exercises to try and re-inforce your coding knowledge and to get you to problem solve. Fortunately, there is a website where you can attempt these exercises online for further practice!

CodeWars Kata start easy at a difficulty of 8 KYU. As you get better, you can go down levels to 1 KYU (that does take a lot of time and commitment though).

## Task

1. Sign up for an account on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). You will have to do a quick kata to get to the signup form! **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you specify `Recode` for clan on the signup (if you do forget, then add it later in Account Settings).

2. Work through the exercises below. If you do finish then browse CodeWars for more exercises and get your points up. Some of these will be hard - you may need to use Google / StackOverflow / Mozilla Developer Network to piece together solutions. Make sure you've gone through the resources on session 1's walkthrough as well.

* [Split in Parts](https://www.codewars.com/kata/split-in-parts/javascript)

## Bonus Points

* Create a repository called `codewars-kata`, and add, commit and push all of your solutions up to it (use the same folder/file structure as the `diy-kata` repository, splitting your solutions out into separate files).
* Look at the tests for each kata on CodeWars and see if you can translate them to Jest.
